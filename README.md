# IPL_data_analysis_and-_prediction
This project was built out of curosity of prediction algorithms.<br/>
IPL is a popular cricketing league with players from all over the world.<br/>
The IPL recently completed 10 years in existence.<br/>
With 10 years worth of data, I wanted to test out prediction algorithms by just inputting match data and not player data.<br/>
The notebook contains visual analysis for IPL data available on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl).<br/>
The notebook also contains logistic regression done on the winners column against a few other variables.<br/>
The result of this regression is a classifier that can predict matches between two teams.<br/>
Analysis on the number of features v/s accuracy correlation has also been performed as indicated by the graph in the end.
